<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
## Welcome!  
I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).  

I am an empirical modeler ([Google Scholar Citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=43woAHgAAAAJ&hl=en), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0000-1249-1300)). My research focuses on quantitative marketing, causal inference, and large language models (LLMs), with a particular interest in digital economics, such as livestream shopping and social media content.  

My work has been published in leading marketing journals, such as *European Journal of Marketing* (AJG/ABS3; ABDC A*; JCR Q1).  

You can find my CV [here](https://xuqiang.github.io/files/CV_XuQiang.pdf).
